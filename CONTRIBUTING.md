# Contributing

Thanks for considering helping this project.  There are many
ways you can help: using the application and reporting bugs,
extrapolating configurations, reporting usability issues, 
making additions and improvements to the library, documentation 
and finding security bugs.

## Reporting bugs

Please file a github issue.  Include as much information as
possible.

## Code changes

Some ideas and guidelines for contributions:

- For large features, file an issue prior to starting work.
  This means everyone can see what is in progress prior to a PR.
- Feel free to submit a PR even if the work is not totally finished,
  for feedback or to hand-over.
- Prefer not to reference github issue or PR numbers in commits.
- Try to keep code formatting commits separate from functional commits.

## Licensing

Contributions are made under [auth0-mapi-apollo's license](./LICENSE).
